Working as part of a cross functional team, created a brand a new responsive web application for nuring faculty using our product as part of their curriculum. I helped shape the product from design sprint phase, through rapid prototyping, user testing, launch of an MVP and additional features.
Working with an accessibility manager, I ensured that the application met WCAG AA standards.
