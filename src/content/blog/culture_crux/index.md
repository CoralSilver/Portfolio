<a rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.culturecrux.com" class="link-darker" target="_blank">Culture Crux</a> is a New York City based arts and culture website which I founded in early 2014. I designed and developed a responsive Wordpress site, where I publish upcoming event listings, reviews of art exhibits, concerts, books, movies, and interviews with artists, musicians, writers, and others.
